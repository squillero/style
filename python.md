# Python

> **Notez Bien**: All these rules are meant to be broken, **BUT** you need a very good reason **AND** you must explain it in a comment.

## Style

### Names (TL;DR)

* `module_name`, `package_name`, `ClassName`, `method_name`, `ExceptionName`, `function_name`, `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`, `function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`.

### General

* Use nouns for variables, full sentences for functions (`factors = factorize(formula)`); predicates (i.e., functions returning a boolean value) should start with the `is_` or `has_` prefix (`if is_gargled(quz):`); factory methods (i.e., functions returning types) are sometimes better described by a noun (`percentage = safe_value(0, 100); val = percentage()`).

* Prefer an f-string (a.k.a., *formatted string literal*) over an explicit formatting operation or the string interpolation operator (`f"v={foo}"` instead of `"v={}".format(foo)` or `"v=%s" % (foo,)`). Use single quotes for string constants such as function parameters and dictionary keys (`'utf-8'` or `data['foo']`); use double quotes for messages to the user.

* To defer the evaluation, use `%-formatting` in logging functions and pass the `%` parameters as arguments (`logging.warning("test: %r != %r", foo, bar)`).

* Start names internal to a module with a single underscore (`_foo`). Don't start names with double underscore (`__foo`); don't dunder (`__foo__`).

* End names with a single underscore only to avoid conflicts (`list_`).

* Define `__all__` when a file is a collection of functions.

* Use `assert` to check the internal consistency and verify the correct usage of methods, not to check for the occurrence of unexpected events. That is, the optimized bytecode should not waste time verifying the correct invocation of methods or running sanity checks.

* In warning and error messages, first describe the problem (`"TypeError: invalid type %s for %s"`); then, if applicable, add a a colon and show the correct alternative (`": expected subclass of %s"`); finally, when possible, add an em dash and give a hint for solving the issue (`"â€” did you instantiate the object adding extra '()'?"`).

* Complex compound statements (i.e., multiple statements on the same line) should be avoided.

* Annotate all functions. Use the documentation at [https://typing.readthedocs.io/](https://typing.readthedocs.io/) as reference, also check the documentation of the module [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing). Consider using [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for linting and type checking.

* Format source code either using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) or [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), try not to mix them in the same project.
  * Set a line length up to 120.
  * Preserve `"` and `'` (see above).
* Use [pyproject.toml](./conf/pyproject.toml) to define options.

* Follow [PEP-440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) for version identification.

### Classes

* Start names private or protected within a class with a single underscore (`_foo`); avoid name mangling if possible (`__foo`).

* Use nouns for properties, full sentences for methods (`foo.factors = bar.factorize(baz.formula)`).

* Do not implement getters and setters, use properties instead. Whether a function does not need parameters consider using a property (`foo.first_bar` instead of `foo.calculate_first_bar()`). Try not to hide complexity: if a task is computationally intensive, using a method might be wiser (`number.get_prime_factors()`).

* Do not override `__repr__`.

* Take advantage of the `abc` infrastructure when defining abstract classes (i.e., inherit from the helper class `ABC`; use the decorators `@abstractmethod` and `@abstractclassmethod`).

* Remember to override `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` if you define `__slots__`; write these functions in the very beginning of the class, before `__init__`. Define `__slots__` only if you are really confident about it.

### Comments and Docstrings

* Use English for names, in docstrings and in comments. Favor formal language over slang, wit over humor, and American English over British.

* Explain the purpose of all functions and classes in docstrings, docstring should give enough information to write the calls and use the classes; be verbose when needed, otherwise use single-line descriptions (note: each verbose description also includes a concise one as its first line).

* Be terse describing class methods, but verbose in the class docstring, possibly including usage examples. Be descriptive (`"""Calculates the next Mersenne prime."""`) rather than imperative. Comment public attributes and properties in the `Attributes` section of the class docstring (even though PyCharm is not supporting it, yet). Comment `__init__` only when its parameters are not obvious.

* Do not explain basic class customizations (`__str__`, ...).  

* Use the style suggested in the [NumPy's style guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard).
